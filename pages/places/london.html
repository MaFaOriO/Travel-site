      <h1>London</h1>

      <p>
        London is the capital and largest city of both England and the United
        Kingdom, with a population of 8,866,180 in 2022. The wider metropolitan
        area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9
        million. London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the
        head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a
        major settlement for nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core and financial
        centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and
        has retained its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the
        west of the City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the
        national government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th
        century, becoming the world's largest city at the time. Since the 19th
        century, the name "London" has referred to the metropolis around the
        City of London, historically split between the counties of Middlesex,
        Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely
        comprised the administrative area of Greater London, governed by 33
        local authorities and the Greater London Authority.
