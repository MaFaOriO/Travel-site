      <h1>Rome</h1>

      <p>
        Rome is the capital city of Italy. It is also the capital of the Lazio
        region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital, and a
        special comune (municipality) named Comune di Roma Capitale. With
        2,860,009 residents in 1,285 <sup>km2</sup>, Rome is the country's most
        populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union
        by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a
        population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan
        city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within
        Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian
        Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber Valley.
        Vatican City (the smallest country in the world and headquarters of the
        worldwide Catholic Church under the governance of the Holy See) is an
        independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only
        existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to
        as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as
        the "Eternal City". Rome is generally considered to be the cradle of
        Western civilization and Western Christian culture, and the centre of
        the Catholic Church.
